### Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## This file contains two functions that are used to create a
## special object that stores a numeric matrix and caches its inverse.

## `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix", which is
##  a list containing a function to
##
##     1.  set the value of the matrix
##     2.  get the value of the matrix
##     3.  set the value of the inverse matrix
##     4.  get the value of the inverse matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
        
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix"
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
## inverse has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the inverse from the
## cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of
## the matrix and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the `setsolve`
## function.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(m)
        m
        
}
